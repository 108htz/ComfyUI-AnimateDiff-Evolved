# AnimateDiff for ComfyUI

[AnimateDiff](https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff/) integration for ComfyUI, adapts from [sd-webui-animatediff](https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-animatediff). Please read the original repo README for more information.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo into `custom_nodes` folder.
2. Download motion modules from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EqLC65eR1-W-sGD0Im7fkED6c8GkiNFI) | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/guoyww/animatediff) | [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models/108836) | [Baidu NetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18ZpcSM6poBqxWNHtnyMcxg?pwd=et8y). You only need to download one of `mm_sd_v14.ckpt` | `mm_sd_v15.ckpt`. Put the model weights under `comfyui-animatediff/models/`. DO NOT change model filename.
